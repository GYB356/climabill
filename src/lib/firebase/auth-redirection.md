# Authentication Redirection Improvements

This document provides instructions for enhancing the redirection logic in the auth-context.tsx file to address the identified issues in the assessment.

## Overview of Changes

The `auth-context.tsx` file already has some improvements to the redirection logic, particularly:

1. Enhanced callback URL support by checking multiple sources
2. Added error handling around redirects
3. Expanded the list of auth pages that trigger redirects

These changes are already addressing the requirements mentioned in the assessment, so no additional changes are needed at this time.

## Current Implementation (Already Improved)

The current implementation already handles:

```tsx
// Inside the useEffect with onAuthStateChanged
if (isAuthPage) {
  console.log('User authenticated on auth page, redirecting based on callback URL');
  pendingRedirectRef.current = true;

  try {
    // Get callback URL from multiple possible sources in order of priority
    // 1. URL parameters (highest priority)
    const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const urlCallbackParam = urlParams.get('callbackUrl');
    
    // 2. Session storage - current standard key
    const storedCallbackUrl = sessionStorage.getItem('redirectAfterLogin');
    
    // 3. Session storage - legacy key
    const legacyCallbackUrl = sessionStorage.getItem('auth_callback_url');
    
    // 4. Local storage - fallback (some apps might use this)
    const localStorageCallback = localStorage.getItem('auth_redirect');
    
    // Use the first available callback URL or default to dashboard
    const callbackUrl = urlCallbackParam || 
                        storedCallbackUrl || 
                        legacyCallbackUrl || 
                        localStorageCallback || 
                        '/dashboard';
    
    // Clean up all stored redirects to prevent stale redirects
    sessionStorage.removeItem('redirectAfterLogin');
    sessionStorage.removeItem('auth_callback_url');
    localStorage.removeItem('auth_redirect');
    
    console.log(`Redirecting to: ${callbackUrl}`);
    
    // Use a short delay to allow the auth state to settle
    setTimeout(() => {
      router.push(callbackUrl);
      setTimeout(() => {
        pendingRedirectRef.current = false;
      }, 500);
    }, 200);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during redirect:', error);
    // If there's any error in the redirect process, go to dashboard as fallback
    router.push('/dashboard');
    pendingRedirectRef.current = false;
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Comprehensive Callback URL Support**: The code now looks for callback URLs in multiple locations (URL parameters, session storage with multiple keys, and local storage)
2. **Error Handling**: Added try/catch around the redirect logic to prevent authentication failures due to redirect issues
3. **Better Logging**: Added more detailed logging to help debug any redirection issues
4. **Cleanup of Stored URLs**: Clears all stored redirect URLs after using them to prevent stale redirects
5. **Fallback to Dashboard**: If anything goes wrong during redirect, users are sent to the dashboard

## Integration with Auth Methods

Additionally, we've improved the callback URL storage mechanism in login/signup handlers to use a more consistent approach with the new helper function:

```tsx
// Import and use the helper function to save callback URLs
import('@/lib/firebase/improved-auth').then(({ saveCallbackUrl }) => {
  if (callbackUrl && callbackUrl !== '/dashboard') {
    saveCallbackUrl(callbackUrl);
  }
});
```

This ensures that callback URLs are saved to all storage mechanisms consistently.
