# ClimaBill Issue Backlog (Prioritized)

## Critical (P0) - Must Fix Before Production

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Slow loading times on authentication pages
   - Unresponsive UI when processing carbon data
   - Memory leaks in chart rendering components

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Missing CSRF protection on form submissions
   - Insecure storage of API keys
   - Incomplete validation of user inputs

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Inconsistent carbon calculation across devices
   - Missing data validation for imported carbon sources
   - Duplicate entries in carbon tracking history

## High Priority (P1) - Important for Launch

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Confusing navigation between dashboard and settings
   - Incomplete error messages for failed operations
   - Missing loading states during data fetching

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Layout issues on small mobile screens
   - Touch targets too small on settings pages
   - PWA installation not properly prompted

6. **Authentication Flow**
   - MFA setup process needs simplification
   - Password reset emails delayed or missing
   - Session persistence issues across browser tabs

## Medium Priority (P2) - Address After Launch

7. **Internationalization**
   - Missing translations for new features
   - Date/time formatting inconsistencies
   - RTL layout support incomplete

8. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation gaps in dashboard
   - Screen reader compatibility issues
   - Insufficient color contrast in charts

9. **Integration Issues**
   - Inconsistent behavior with third-party carbon APIs
   - Payment provider webhook reliability
   - Email delivery service occasional failures

## Low Priority (P3) - Nice to Have

10. **Performance Optimization**
    - Further code splitting for faster initial load
    - Preloading of frequently accessed resources
    - Image optimization for faster page rendering

11. **Developer Experience**
    - Improve documentation for custom hooks
    - Standardize component prop interfaces
    - Enhance test coverage for utility functions

12. **Analytics Implementation**
    - More granular user journey tracking
    - Custom event tracking for carbon reduction actions
    - Conversion funnel optimization

## Technical Debt (Ongoing)

13. **Code Quality**
    - Refactor legacy components to use React hooks
    - Remove unused dependencies
    - Standardize error handling across the application

14. **Infrastructure**
    - Implement database indexing for common queries
    - Optimize serverless function cold start times
    - Set up automated database backups

15. **Build Process**
    - Reduce bundle size through better tree shaking
    - Implement differential loading for modern browsers
    - Optimize asset caching strategy
